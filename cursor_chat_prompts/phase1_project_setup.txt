### Phase 1: Project Setup

**Status: Completed**

1. **Initialize project structure** âœ…
   - Project directories and files created as per PRD.
2. **Create requirements.txt** (Replaced by Poetry)
   - Instead of requirements.txt, the project now uses Poetry for dependency management.
   - A `pyproject.toml` file was created with all dependencies and dev tools.
   - The project is configured for **Python 3.12** for maximum compatibility and stability.
   - All dependencies are installed and managed via Poetry.

**Notes:**
- Poetry provides better dependency resolution, reproducible builds, and modern Python packaging.
- To install dependencies, use: `poetry install`
- To run the app: `poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
- To run tests: `poetry run pytest tests/ -v`
